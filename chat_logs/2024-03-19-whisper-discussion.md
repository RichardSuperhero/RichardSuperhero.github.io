# Whisper Integration Discussion - March 19, 2024

## Initial Project Requirements
- Custom iPhone app using OpenAI's Whisper for voice recognition
- Syncs notes to website text file via git updates
- Estimated project size: 2,000-3,300 lines of code
- Local Whisper model sizes discussed (V2):
  - Tiny: ~75MB
  - Base: ~142MB
  - Small: ~466MB
  - Medium: ~1.5GB
  - Large: ~3GB

## Web Implementation Discussion
- Proposed using Transformers.js for browser-based implementation
- Discussion of Whisper V3 updates (March 2024):
  - V3 models are approximately 2x faster than V2
  - Improved handling of speaker turns and punctuation
  - Better timestamp accuracy
  - Enhanced performance for non-English languages
  - New optimized "tiny.en" model specifically for English

## Technical Components Discussed
1. iOS App Components:
   - Audio Recording Module
   - Whisper Integration
   - Note Sync Module
   - UI Implementation

2. Website Backend:
   - API Endpoints
   - Git Integration
   - File Management

## Development Considerations
- Processing options: Local vs API-based
- Security considerations for API endpoints
- Battery optimization for mobile
- Git webhook security

## Next Steps
- Update implementation to use latest Whisper V3 models
- Consider browser-based implementation using Transformers.js
- Evaluate performance requirements and model size tradeoffs
